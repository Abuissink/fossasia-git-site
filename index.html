                    <h1>Learn Git with FOSSASIA</h1>


                    <p><b>What is Git?</b> Git is a type of software called a
                    <i>Version Control System</i>. With it, you can manage
                    projects that you, and other people around the world, make
                    and contribute to, without fear of losing code or breaking
                    the project's code. By following along with this tutorial,
                    you'll learn first how to set up Git for projects on your
                    local computer, and build up to using GitHub and being able
                    to contribute to open-source software projects!</p>


                    <p>But first, you'll need to check you have Git installed
                    on your system. Try typing <span class="code">git</span> in
                    the terminal if you are on Linux or Mac OS X. If you are on
                    Windows, or the <span class="code">git</span> command
                    fails, check the tabs below to learn how to install
                    Git.</p>

                            <p>There are a few ways to install Git on Windows.
                            The most official build is available for download
                            on the Git website. Just go to <a href=
                            "http://git-scm.com/download/win%20and%20the%20download%20will%20start%20automatically">
                            this link</a>. Note that this is a project called
                            Git for Windows, which is separate from Git itself;
                            for more information on it, go to <a href=
                            "https://git-for-windows.github.io/">this
                            page</a>.</p>


                            <p>Another easy way to get Git installed is by
                            installing GitHub for Windows. The installer
                            includes a command line version of Git as well as
                            the GUI. It also works well with Powershell, and
                            sets up solid credential caching and sane CRLF
                            settings. We’ll learn more about those things a
                            little later, but suffice it to say they’re things
                            you want. You can download this from the GitHub for
                            Windows website, at <a href=
                            "http://windows.github.com">http://windows.github.com</a></p>

                        <p>So you've made some changes, and you've used
                        <span class="code">git status</span> to check
                        <i>exactly which</i> files need to be <span class=

                        name]</span> for all the files that have been changed
                        to stage them to the commit. The command <span class=
                        "code">git stage [file name]</span> does the same thing
                        as <span class="code">git add</span>, so you can use
                        whichever version you like. You can also <span class=
                        "code">add</span> multiple files at the same time by
                        listen the files one after the other, like <span class=

                        <span class="code">git log</span>, which prints out a
                        list of all previous commits. Notice that each commit
                        has a unique ID number. You may need to press 'q' to
                        exit <span class="code">git log</span>. This command
                        may not seem useful right now, but it will come in
                        handy a lot once you learn more Git.</p>

                        <p>So sometimes you want to save your changes with Git
                        but don't want to make the step to a whole new commit
                        next time. Easy! Just run <span class="code">git
                        stash</span> and Git will make a record of your changes
                        but not make a commit. To apply the stashed changes
                        later, just run <span class="code">git stash
                        apply</span>. This command comes in handy when you need
                        to save your changes, when you switch branches, for
                        instance (more on this later).</p>

                        the lines added/deleted, and files changed in the
                        specified commit. The HEAD commit is the most recent

                        <span class="code">HEAD~n</span> where <span class=

                        you want to go. For example, the second most recent

                        <p>So sometimes, you make mistakes. Hey, we all do.
                        What happens if you make mistakes in your code, we know
                        how to use <span class="code">git diff</span> to check
                        exactly what you changed (if you can't remember, no
                        biggie, just check up the page a bit). If you regret
                        making all your changes in a certain file, you can use
                        <span class="code">git checkout HEAD [filename]</span>
                        to restore a certain file to its HEAD version. We'll
                        learn more about <span class="code">git checkout</span>
                        later when we learn more about branches.</p>

                        <p>It is good Git practice to keep commits to only one
                        topic. If you've accidentally <span class=
                        "code">stage</span>d a file for a commit (remember how
                        we learnt that at the beginning?) The command
                        <span class="code">git reset HEAD [filename]</span>
                        resets the file in the staging area to the HEAD version
                        (from the last commit) but keeps the changes in the
                        working directory (as opposed to <span class="code">git
                        checkout</span>, which changes the file in the working
                        directory itself back to the HEAD commit.</p>

                        <p><span class="code">git reset</span> can also be used
                        to reset your project to a happier, stabler commit.
                        Like in the gif above, you'll need the first seven
                        characters of the ID number, or SHA, written in
                        <span class="code">git log</span>. Alternatively, you
                        can use the <span class="code">HEAD~n</span> syntax
                        instead, if you wish. To recap, <span>reset</span>
                        reverts the project to a previous state, and Git
                        forgets about the commits that went after that
                        state.</p>

                        <p>Up to this point, we've been working in a single
                        branch, <span class="code">master</span>. If you look

                        different versions of the project. A branch is

                        [branchname] will be created. Notice that it
                        automatically switches to your new branch. Handy!</p>

                        <p>So you've made an <i>awesome</i> addition to your
                        code on another branch, and you want to add your
                        changes to the main branch. Switch to the branch you
                        want to pull the changes into, using <span class=
                        "code">git checkout [into-branch]</span> and then run
                        <span class="code">git merge [from-branch]</span> where
                        <span class="code">[from-branch]</span> is the branch

                        like:<br>

                        Delete <em>everything</em> except the version you want

                        Git will still think the merge conflict is present. To
                        finish the merge, just run <span class="code">git

                    <p>GitHub is a website that runs a Git hosting platform,
                    where over 12 million users store and contribute to over 30
                    million projects. Many open-source software organisations,
                    such as FOSSASIA, store their code in GitHub repos, where
                    anyone can contribute to them. This following section will
                    provide a brief introduction into GitHub, and commands used
                    when dealing with remote repositories. For a way more
                    in-depth guide to GitHub, click the link below.</p>

                        </div>


                        <p>Once, you've signed up/logged into GitHub, you'll
                        want to start contributing to a repo. Once you find one
                        that suits your fancy, click the 'Fork' button to copy
                        the main repo into a personal version listed under your
                        name. All GitHub repos have the url <span class=
                        "code">github.com/username/reponame</span>. Once you're
                        in your personal repo, find the HTTPS path in the top
                        right of the repo (see above gif). Make sure you have
                        your personal fork, as you probably won't be able to
                        <span class="code">push</span> your changes to the main
                        repo. Copy that URL, and open up a terminal in the
                        folder where you'd like the repo folder to be located.
                        Run <span class="code">git clone [url]</span> and a
                        folder containing the HEAD commit from the GitHub repo
                        will now exist locally on your computer.</p>

                        </div>


                        <p>So you've set up the repo from GitHub- great! Now,
                        how do you sync to/from the GitHub server? One half of
                        that is <span class="code">git pull origin
                        [localbranch]. Origin</span> is the remote location, in
                        our case GitHub. Think of <span class="code">git pull
                        origin master</span> as like <span class="code">git
                        merge origin</span>. <span class="code">Git pull</span>
                        is basically a merge, if there is a merge conflict you
                        have to deal with it in the same way too.</p>

                        <p><span class="code">Git push</span> is the opposite
                        of <span class="code">git pull</span> and the other
                        half of the sync process. This command takes the
                        commits not registered with the remote repo and
                        registers them there, uploading the new changes to the
                            server. Unlike <span class="code">pull</span>, <span class="code">push</span>
                        requires you to authenticate, just give it your GitHub
                        username and password (assuming the repo is on GitHub!)
                        and the upload should be successful. If not, you may
                        have to use <span class="code">git pull</span> changes
                        from <span class="code">origin</span> first.</p>

                        </div>


                        <p><span class="code">Git rebase</span> is probably the
                        most confusing command covered in this tutorial, but
                        it's the most powerful. <span class=
                        "code">Rebase</span> is essentially moving a branch
                        from one commit to another. It (like most Git commands)
                        has many different options, but the one shown above,
                        and the one arguably used the most often is
                        <span class="code">git rebase -i HEAD~n</span>, which
                        allows you to <span class="code">squash</span> or
                        <span class="code">flatten</span> several different
                        commits. Once Nano (or whatever your default text
                        editor is) has loaded, you will see a list of all the
                        commits you specified all marked <span class=
                        "code">pick</span>. You must keep at least one as
                        <span class="code">pick</span>, but you can change
                        commits listed below a <span class="code">pick</span>
                        to either <span class="code">squash / s</span> or
                        <span class="code">flatten /f</span> to merge their
                        commits with the nearest-up commit marked as
                        <span class="code">pick</span>, keeping and discarding
                        their commit messages respectively. This comes in handy
                        when making a pull request, as it means you only have
                        to deal with one commit in the request.</p>
